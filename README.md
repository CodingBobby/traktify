Traktify's dashboard offers a clean overview of whats up next to watch for you. From here, you can add episodes you just watched to your history. The search panel allows blazing-fast access to the entire trakt database. Via shortcuts, filtering search results is made very easy.

## Getting started
Traktify is currently at it's climax of development. You can dive in really soon.

### Requirements
Traktify is an electron based app and thus requires a Windows 7 (and higher) or macOS 10.10 (and higher) machine to run on. You'll also need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installation. Traktify is tested on versions higher than `v10.10.0` but we recommend the latest `LTS` release.

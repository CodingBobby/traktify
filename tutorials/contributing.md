<a name="quickstart"></a>

## Quickstart
To start working on Traktify, you first need to clone this repository and move into the branch of interest:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CodingBobby/traktify.git
cd traktify
git checkout rebuild
```
After that, you install the required dependencies.
This might take a while.
```sh
brew install node npm
npm i
```

Because Traktify uses several APIs, you will need keys for them.
Required for functionlity is at least the `trakt.tv` API -- you can obtain an ID and a secret key by creating a new application [here](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications).

Create a new file called `src/keys.secret.json` and insert those keys like so:
```json
{
   "trakt_id": "<long_secret_id>",
   "trakt_secret": "<long_secret_key>"
}
```

Now, you can hop in and do several things:
 - Start app in development mode: `npm start`
 - Run test suites: `npm run test`
 - Generate documentation locally: `npm run build-docs`

## Guidelines

<a name="code-standards"></a>

#### Code Standards
Readable code is top priority.
When contributing, follow a general code standard like [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) to ensure this.
We are not very consistent ourselves but please, avoid weird code formatting.

We also encourage you to document your code using the [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) syntax.
This enables us to work type-sensitive which is awesome.
Instead of:

```js
// This function returns the sum of numbers inside an array.
function sumArray (arr) {
   let sum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
   return sum
}
```
â€¦ do:
```js
/**
 * Adds the values inside an array.
 * @param {Array.<Number>} arr The array to sum
 * @returns {Number} Sum of array
 */
function sumArray (arr) {
   let sum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
   return sum
}
```

Without any comments other people reading your code would have to search and read docs from traktify, mozilla and electron and look through the app files before understanding whats going on.
**We want each file to be as understandable as possible on its own without additional information.**

<a name="commits"></a>

#### Commits
First of all, do not worry about "too little" changes.
If a single additional line of code fixes a bug, thats commit-worthy.
Do not gather a bunch of additions or modifications and combine them into one commit but split them into "topics" they are related to.

Inside your commit message, you will need to brievely explain
- what you did
- why it was necessary
- what side effects result from it.

Please describe your changes in **full sentences** and make sure to start with a descriptive title that indicates whether a bug was fixed, a feature added or the code improved in any other sense.
